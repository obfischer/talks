=== How does it work?

[plantuml]
----
@startuml

start

:Write the documentation;
note left
    The documentation must be written
    in Asciidoctor; rules can be embedded
    directly in the documents
end note

while (Generate documentation?)
    :Scan all artifacts;
    :Analyse the graph;
    :Write report;
    note left
        The report is generated based
        on the Asciidoctor documents;
        results of querys will be embedded
    end note
endwhile

stop
