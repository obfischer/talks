=== The Git History Is a Graph

// * A commit belongs to an author and contains one or more changes where each one modifies a file.
// * All commits except the initial one have at least one relation to a parent commit.
// * A branch is represented by a node which references the last commit, i.e. the head of the branch.
// * A parent commit with more than one child indicates that a new branch has been created.
// * Commits with more than one parent relation are merge commits.
// * A tag references a commit

* Git history contains much more information
  than visible at the first glance
* It is valuable to combine data from
  different sources (Git, Java code, ...)
* You musk simply ask the right question
