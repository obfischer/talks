____
*Software Architecture* is whole set of
rules which must be applied to a system.
____

=== Rules can be simple

IMPORTANT: Each Git repository must contain a `readme.adoc`
           with a short project description.

=== Rules can be complex

IMPORTANT: All configuration classes in a Spring project
           must be the `xyz.configuration` package, must
           be validated, their name must end with `Properties` and
           start with the prefix of the properties to bind to
           the concrete instance of the class.

[source,java]
----
@ConfigurationProperties("tomcat")
@Validated
public class TomcatProperties {
}

=== Why is it so difficult to keep software consistent?

[%step]
* Design is only implicit or no design at all
* Erodes by time
* Different programmers - different approaches
* No maintenance
* New and _modern_ approaches (Software development is like the fashion business)
* No holistic/integrated tooling
